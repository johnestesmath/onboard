  <title>A Special Triangle</title>

  <p>
    You can find all sorts of interesting examples of surprising structures in the universe of mathematics. One such example is
   a very special triangle of numbers that's easy to construct and borderline ubiquitous in its applications.
  </p>

  <p> This triangle goes by many names and was discovered by several cultures in history. In 450 BC, Indian mathematician, Pingata, called
    this new construction the "Staircase of Mount Meru". Persian mathematician, Omar Khayyam, discovered "Khauuam's Triangle" in the 11th century,
     and close to the same time, Chinese mathematician, Jin Xian, discovered "Yang Hui's Triangle".
      In the western world, this triangle is most commonly refered to as Pascal's Triangle, named after
      french mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who discovered this triangle in the 17th century.

    <title>Constructing Pascal's Triangle</title>
    
    <p> Now you're going to build Pascal's Triangle. The row is just a <m>1</m>, and the 
    second row is composed of <m>1, 1</m>. The third row looks like <m>1, 2
      , 1</m> like below. We'll call these rows row 0, row 1, and row 2.</p>

      <table>
      <tabular>
        <row>
          <cell> </cell>
          <cell></cell>
          <cell><m>1</m></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell></cell>
          <cell><m>1</m></cell>
          <cell></cell>
          <cell><m>1</m></cell>
          <cell></cell>
        </row>
        <row>
          <cell><m>1</m></cell>
          <cell><m></m></cell>
          <cell><m>2</m></cell>
          <cell></cell>
          <cell><m>1</m></cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>
    </table>

    <p>
      Where did the <m>2</m> come from? We simply got it by
      adding the two <m>1</m>'s above it in row 1. For the next row (row 3), we'd start with
      <m>1</m>. Then we have the sum of the two numbers above our second number (<m>1 + 2</m>). Next is the sum (<m>2+1</m>),
      and finally we end the row with 1. That is, row 3 is <m>1, 3, 3, 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then we just repeat this process.

        <p>
          Fill out row 4 of Pascal's Triangle.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Following the same process, row 4 has entries
          <m>1, (1+3), (3+3), (3+1), 1 </m> or <m>1, 4, 6, 4, 1</m>.

    <p>
      Pascal's triangle has interested mathematicians for centuries, as it is filled
      with interesting patterns. 
    </p>

    <question> 
      <title>Adding along a row</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          Add entries of rows 0 through 4. What pattern do you notice?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The sume of entries of rows 0 through 4 are <m>1, 2, 4, 8, 16</m> respectively.
          These looks like powers of <m>2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </question>

    <p> 
      This is just one pattern of Pascal's triangle, but there are many more. TedEd hightlights
      some of these patterns in this very visual video.
