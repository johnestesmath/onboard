  <title>Archimedes' Great Idea</title>

  <p> Modern Calculus was formulated by Sir Isaac Newton and Gotfriend Leibniz in 1687. But the great mathematician, Archimedes, was really close to developing Calculus in 300 B.C. 
    (Almost 2000 years before Newton and Leibniz!) with the formation of the limit: the
   starting point of well-defined calculus (though he never used the word ``limit" in his construction.).  </p>

    <title>What is this weird number?</title>

    <p>
        To illustrate how Archimedes was thinking in terms of calculus, we should think about circles. Ancient cultures were puzzled that every circle 
        carried an unusual trait with it. 
        That is, if the circle had diameter <m>d</m>, then it would take length <m>3d</m> 
        plus a tiny bit more to wrap around the circumference. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This fact was true with every circle, and each culture attempted 
        to calculate the number that was the ratio of circumference to diameter. 
        No one in the ancient world estimated it as well as Archimedes did.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what is this number? We define
         <m>\pi</m> as <m>\pi = \dfrac{c}{d}</m> for the circle with circumference <m>c</m> and 
         diameter <m>d</m>. Computers can now calculate <m>\pi</m> to millions of digits, but <m>\pi</m> eluded the 
         greatest of minds for centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
        For reference, here are the first 30 digits of <m>\pi</m>.

        <me>
        \pi \approx 3.14159265358979323846264338327

    <title>Archimedes' Estimate</title>

    <p>
        Archimedes was interested in figuring out the very mysterious number of <m>\pi</m>, and eventually 
        estimated <m>\pi</m> to be between <m>21/7</m> and <m>210/71</m> (or between <m>3.1408 \text{ and } 3.1429</m>). 
        That's really, really close for 300 BC.
