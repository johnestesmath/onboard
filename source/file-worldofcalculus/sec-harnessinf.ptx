  <title>Harnessing <m>\infty</m></title>

  <p> "What is the largest number you can think of?" Hopefully, you see that is a 
    question with no real answer. Maybe the closest we can come to answering that 
question is <m>\infty  \ldots</m> even though we know <m>\infty</m> is not a number. 
  </p>
<p> In fact, <m>\infty </m> is a weird creature. It breaks some of our number-intuition.
    It feels like <m>\infty</m> just does not behave. For example, can we add an infinite
    number of numbers and get something finite? We'll see that you can <m>\ldots</m> sometimes. Some of our normal addition rules act
differently when <m>\infty</m> is involved. For example, can <m>\infty</m> help us
show that <m>0 = 1 </m>? Let's start with <m>0</m>, and we know that  <m> 0 = 1 + -1 = 1 + -1 + 1 + -1.</m> 
Can't we do this forever?</p>

<p>
    <md>
      <mrow>0  \amp = (1 + -1) + (1 + -1) + 1 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow>   \amp =  1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = 1 + 0 + 0 + \ldots </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp  = 1</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
<p>
   This is a problem! Apparently, the associate law of addition
   doesn't play well with <m>\infty</m>. You'll discuss this example in 
   greater detail in a later course, but this is enough to show that <m>\infty</m>
   can be very unusual.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms that are all booked. This
  example is called <term>Hilbert's Hotel</term> and is a great example to show that
  <m>\infty</m> does not behave with arithmetic like we typically like.

        This time, <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}</m> seems to get larger and larger. We could say that

        <m>f(x)</m> trends towards <m>\infty</m>.

    <p>
      Trends like the ones we looked at in <xref ref="ac-limits1"/> and <xref ref="ac-limits2"/> 
      are examples of <term>limits</term>, a foundational tool in the study of Calculus. We 
      would write the conclusions from the past activities like
      <me> \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{1}{x} = 0 \text{ and } \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \dfrac{1}{x} = \infty.</me>
      We'll
      save defining limits clearly for your other coursework, but we can think about limits
      intuitively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Firstly, we can think of limits as a way to introduce motion
      on paper. We "watched" the behavior of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}</m> as <m>x</m> "moved" towards
      <m>\infty</m>. There are other examples in which we allow the number rectangles or
      the number of sides or the number terms and so on extend towards <m>\infty</m>. The limit
      is similar to the play button on a YouTube video. When you see <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a}</m>,
      you can just imagine some sort of movement or change on your paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, the limit is the tool that allows us to tame <m>\infty</m>... Well, not "tame" <m>\infty</m>,
      but we can utilize <m>\infty</m> with a limit to accomplish some incredible things. We don't tame the Mississippi River,
      but it is an enormous resource!

  <title>So what is Calculus?</title>
  <p>
    So what is calculus exactly? Calculus is a multifaceted branch of mathematics that 
    serves as the bedrock of an enormous number of applications in a 
    a huge variety of fields. However, common to all of the underlying ideas of calculus is
    harnessing <m>\infty</m> through limits to do something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's look at some examples of how, in some cases, we can predict the infinite.
    The first should be familiar to us.

      Earlier, we added <m>1 + -1 + \ldots</m> an infinite number of times. Can we actually

      possible."
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>geometric series</term> is a summation of the powers of a number <m>r</m>. So it

      <me>r^0 + r^1 + r^2 + \ldots + r^n + \ldots.</me>
      For a lot of numbers, this sum gets larger and larger, but if <m> |r| \lt 1</m>, the sum
      will equal <m>1/(1-r)</m>. This should surprise you in some way. We can add

    <p>
      Let's look at one more example.
    </p>
  
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-recursive">
  <title>Recursive Sequences</title>

  <p>
    A <term>sequence</term>, <m>(a_n)</m>, is just an infinite list of terms. A familiar example would
    be <m>1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots</m>, the sequence of natural numbers. A sequence is different
    than a set in that the order of the terms matters. So <m>a_i</m> is the <m>i^{th}</m> term
    in the sequence <m>(a_n)</m>. Make sense? The terms in a sequence typically are defined by a rule. For example, if <m>a_n = n^2 + 1</m>, then <m>(a_n) = (1^2 +1), (2^2 + 1), \ldots , (n^2 +1), \ldots</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    A sequence is a <term>recursive sequence</term> if the rule for <m>a_n</m> involves earlier terms in the sequence. For example, suppose
    <m>a_1 = 1</m> and, after the first term, <m>a_n = \dfrac{4a_{n-1}}{3a_{n-1}+3}</m>. Then <m>a_2 = 4(a_1)/(3a_1 + 3) = 4/(3 + 3) = 2/3,</m> and
    so on.

  </p>

  <question xml:id="ques-recursive1">
    <title>Recursive Terms</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is <m>a_3</m> in our recursive sequence?
      </p>
    </statement>
    
  </question>


  <p>
    The big question is whether this recurvise sequence, like the 
    function and the geometric series we saw earlier, has a limit? The answer
    is "yes", but how would we find it?
  </p>

  <p>
    If you take an analysis course (Maybe Advanced Calculus or Intro to Real Analysis), you will see questions like this, and to find
    a limit of our recursive sequence you would have to <term>prove</term> two important pieces of information. First, the terms in our sequence either need
    to get progessively smaller or larger with each sequential term, and secondly all of the terms must be smaller than some 
    number <m>b</m> and larger than another number <m>c</m> (That is, <m>c \leq a_n \leq b</m> for each term <m>a_n</m>.).
  </p>

  <p>
    If these two facts are true, then the <term>Monotone Convergence Theorem</term> guarantees the recursive sequence has
    a limit. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To save us some trouble, we'll use Sage to calculate a few terms of our sequence.

  <p>
    In mathematics, it's not a good idea to take things for granted, but for the purpose of illustration,
    suppose we have shown that <m>(a_n)</m> is decreasing (getting smaller with each term) and always
    larger than <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>. That means that our sequence does have a limit. Let's call
    this mysterious limit point <m>a</m>, and here's how we find what <m>a</m> is.
  </p>

  <p>
    We know that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(a_n) = a</m>, and so that
    also means that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(a_{n-1}) = a</m> (How would the
    very first term really affect what the sequence approaches towards <m>\infty</m>?). So
    <md>
      <mrow> a \amp = \displaystyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}(a_n) </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{4a_{n-1}}{3a_{n-1}+3} </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \dfrac{\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}4a_{n-1}}{\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(3a_{n-1}+3)}</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \dfrac{4a}{3a + 3}.</mrow>
    </md>
  
  </p>

  <p>
    All of that to say that our limit <m>a</m> satisfies the equation <m>a = 4a/(3a + 3).</m>
  </p>

  <question xml:id="ques-mct3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the limit point of our sequence by solving the equation <m>a = 4a/(3a + 3).</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This is just algebra at this point.

        <md>
          <mrow>a \amp = \dfrac{4a}{3a + 3} </mrow>
          <mrow> a(3a+3)\amp = 4a </mrow>
          <mrow> 3a^2 - a \amp = 0 </mrow>
          <mrow> a(3a-1) \amp = 0. </mrow>
        </md>

        So either <m>a = 0</m> or <m>a = 1/3</m>, but we already know that
        <m>a \geq 1/3,</m> so <m>a = 1/3</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
    
  </question>

  <p>
    This is a complicated example, but we are highlighting how even though 
    <m>\infty</m> can act strangely, we can use it to answer complicated quesetions...
    like how this sequence will trend towards <m>1/3</m>!
