  <title> Introduction to Belhaven Mathematics </title>

  

  <p>
   Welcome to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University, one department under Belhaven's 
   School of Science &amp; Mathematics. We work hard to provide unique
   learning opportunities, to do a lot of math, and to have fun while we grow. Maybe we can best summarize what Belhaven MCS
   is about with the three crucial pillars of our identity:
   <ol>
     <li>
       Community, 
     </li>
     <li>Academic experiences,  </li>
     <li> Service. </li>
   </ol>
   
 </p>

 <remark>
   <title>Keep these pillars in mind</title>
   Community. Academic experiences. Service.
 </remark>

 <p>
  We believe that our students reach their greatest potential by
  following these pillars, and we strive to incorporate these values
  throughout our curriculum. 
 </p>

<p>
  Do you want to get the most out of your college experience? We picked community as our first pillar for a reason. 
We want you to be a part of something special! While we provide opportunities for you, it's up to you to
    take advantage of them. 
    
</p>   

<p>
  But we have a lot of opportunities for you to get involved quickly!

  <p>
    Good communication is so undervalued. Go talk to your professors. At Belhaven,
    we want to know our students. Meet your classmates. They're going to help you through
    this next assignmnent.

 <p>Your degree is measured in credit hours. You're taking classes ultimately to earn a degree. 
  You'll also expect some grades in those classes. BUT let's be careful not to mistake grades and
  credit hours with actual learning. Our goal in the MCS Department is provide an environment of
  true learning. We want you to adapt a mentality of a continual learning: one who learns inside
  and outside of the classroom.
  </p>

  <p>
  In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, 
  and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number curriculum add-ons. 
  Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.
  </p>

   <subsection> 
      <title>Mathematical Research</title>
  
  <p>In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process 
  reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will
   present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate 
   Research Symposium (BUURS) and our sectional meetings of the MAA.</p>        
  </subsection>

  <subsection> 
      <title>The Eyes of Faith Portfolio</title>
  
  <p>What does the Bible say about mathematics? What does life as a Christian mathematician entail? 
  What role does change and randomness play in God's creation? These are deep questions that we will 
  ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.
  </p>

  <p> The book <term>Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith</term> by Russell Howell and James Bradley 
  approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner <xref ref="biblio-eyes"/>. Students will 
  use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their <term>Eyes of Faith Portfolio</term>,
  a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.
  </p>

  <p> The chapter breakdown follows curiously close to our major requirements and 
  is summarized in the following table. (You might want to hang on to this one.)

<subsection> 
      <title>For Engineering Majors</title>
  
  <p> In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership 
    <ui>
      <li>learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering</li>
      <li>interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.</li>
      <li>take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S.
       Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).</li>
    </ui>
  </p>        
</subsection>

<subsection> 
      <title>For Actuarial Science Majors</title>
  
  <p>For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will
    <ui>
      <li>learn statistical software such as R,</li>
      <li> sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P).</li>
    </ui>
  </p>        
</subsection>

<subsection> 
      <title>Seminars</title>
  
  <p> Several times a year, we bring in speakers to present topics not typically covered in a standard course. 
  Attending these talks is a fantastic way to meet professionals who are doing what you hope to do one day and reinforces
  our pillars of community and academic experiences. 
  </p>
  <p> Just a few examples: 
    <ui>
      <li>professors from other universities sharing their research</li>
      <li>professional actuaries looking for interns</li>
      <li>scientists from NASA, the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and the US Corps of Engineers</li>
      <li>industry professionals in the fields of engineerng and computer science.</li>
    </ui>
  </p>        
</subsection>

<p> Young students often underestimate the power of good communication. The quicker you get comfortable with
  communicating with peers, professors, and advisors the better. In addition to email, most courses in the MCS
   utilize Microsoft Teams, a professional, team-building messaging app. The quickest and easiest way to support
   the Community pillar of the MCS Mission Statement is to simply download Teams, join our course's team (listed in the syllabus), 
   join the BelhavenSTEM team, and turn on notifications in both!
