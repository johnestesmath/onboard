  <title>Pipe Algebra</title>

  <p> If you were born sometime after the mid-80's, chances are you have played a
    popular game featuring a pair of Italian plumbers. Something about pipes.</p>

  <p>
    Imagine a pipe network like the one in <xref ref="fig-pipes1"/>. In this figure,
    we mark the volume of water moving across these pipes over a given period of time (we call that
    the <term>flow rate</term>) as well as the direction of flow
    along the pipes. As you can see, we can measure the 
    flow rate on some of the pipes, but not all of them. But we would really like 
    to know the how much water is passing through all of them.

  <p>
    At each intersection point, you might notice there are some pipes flowing
    into that point and others flowing out. Actually, that observation might
    give us some insight.

  <question xml:id="q-kirchoff">
    <statement>
        <p>
         Suppose we know that 100 cubic meters of water is flowing into
         one intersection point. How much water is flowing out of that intersection point?
        </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
          The water can't stay at the intersection point, so 100 cubic meters is flowing
          out from that point.  
        </p>
    </solution>
  </question>

  <p>
    We now know that at a given intersection point, the total that flows into the intersection
    is the same as the total flow that flows out from that intersection point. This introduces
    an equation! This principle is referred to <term>Kirchoff's Law of Flow</term>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So our question is, "What possible values along the pipes marked <m>x_1</m> 
    through <m>x_6</m> satisfy Kirchoff's Law of Flow?" If we can answer this question, then
    we will know all of the flowrates along our pipe system.
