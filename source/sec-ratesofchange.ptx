  <title>Rates of Change</title>

  <p>Did you know crows give gifts? Some people
    have found that if you routinely feed local crows or ravens, they 
    will eventually return the favor by bringing trinkets. People have reported
  that their crow friends have brought bottle caps, sticks, feathers, and miscelaneous
    shiny objects. </p>

    <p>
      Imagine your friend, Lucas, has a crow friend, and his crow brings him
      two small gifts a day. So the shoebox where Lucas keeps these gifts grows by
      two items a day. We can chart it like below.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-rates1">
      <caption>Crow-friend presents</caption>
      <sageplot>
        f(x) = 2x
        plot(f, (x, 0, 8), color='blue', thickness=3)
      </sageplot>
    </figure>
    
  <p>
    We see here an example of linear data. That is, if we chart this information,
    we can see a straight line with equation <m>y = mx + b</m>, where <m>b</m> is 
    our initial amount (or <m>y</m>-intercept) and <m>m</m> is our slope.
  </p>

  <p>
    What does <term>slope</term> mean exactly? The graph in <xref ref="fig-rates1"/> 
    is <m>y = 2x</m>, and so the slope is <m>2</m>. But what does that mean? The
    slope refers to how quickly our line is changing... a <term>rate of change</term>. 
    In this case, <m>m = 2</m> gifts per day. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This is exactly why the slope formula is 
    <me>m = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \text{ with points } (x_1,y_1) \text{ and } (x_2,y_2).</me>
    The rate of change is measured by "change in <m>y</m> over change in <m>x</m>".

    <title>Throwing a Ball</title>
    <p>
      A lot of situations aren't linear, though, right? For example, if we throw 
      a ball straight up, thanks to gravity which accelerates over times, after
      <m>t</m> seconds, the ball is at height <m>s = -16t^2 + vt + h</m> units. Here, <m>v</m>
      is initial velocity and <m>h</m> is the initial height.
    </p>

    <p>
      This obviously has a rate of change, but our slope formula doesn't seem
      to make sense anymore. So how do we find how quickly a ball is moving in the air?
