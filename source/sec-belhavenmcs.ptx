  <title> Introduction to Belhaven Mathematics </title>

  <p>
   Welcome to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department (MCS) at Belhaven University, one department under Belhaven's 
   School of Science &amp; Mathematics. We work hard to provide unique
   learning opportunities, to do a lot of math, and to have fun while we grow. Maybe we can best summarize what Belhaven MCS
   is about with the three crucial pillars of our identity:
   <ol>
     <li>
       Community, 
     </li>
     <li>Academic experiences,  </li>
     <li> Service. </li>
   </ol>

 </p>

 <remark>
   <title>Keep these pillars in mind</title>
   Community. Academic experiences. Service.
 </remark>

 <p>
  We believe that our students reach their greatest potential by
  following these pillars, and we strive to incorporate these values
  throughout our curriculum. 
 </p>

 <subsection xml:id="subsec-community">
  <title>Community</title>

 <figure>
  <image xml:id="fig-maa24" source="maa24.jpg" width="80%" />
</figure>

<p>
  We are very proud of the community of students, faculty, and staff that we have in the 
  Belhaven Math &amp; Computer Science department, and we're excited about you
  joining us. 
</p>

<p>
  Do you want to get the most out of your college experience? We picked community as our first pillar for a reason. 
We want you to be a part of something special! Our most successful students at Belhaven are the ones who
    get involved early and often, and we encourage you to be an active part of our community.
    
</p>   

<p>
  And we have a lot of opportunities for you to get involved quickly!
</p>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-mcsclub">
  <title>MCS Club</title>
  <p>
    The student-led Math &amp; Computer Science Club gets together frequently to play games,
    eat some food, and sneak in some math and computer science. The MCS Club members help each other
    with resumes, projects, 3D printing, and more.
    </p>

    </figure>
    

    <p>
      The MCS Club is unique in that it also serves as student chapters for both the MAA (Mathematical
      Association of America) and the ACM (Association of Computing &amp; Machinery), so it's like two
      clubs in one. Club membership guarantees membership to one of these professional societies at a very
      discounted rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do you want to join the MCS Club? Of course! Let your instructor know to get
      further details.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-social">
  <title>STEM Events</title>
  <p>
    The MCS Department and the School of Science and Mathematics hosts a variety of events. It's 
    important to join the larger science community at Belhaven. Usually food is involved too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be on the lookout for
    <ul>
      <li> <p>Homecoming tailgating: Belhaven STEM puts on a spread for students and alumni before
          the football homecoming game. </p>

          <figure>
            <image source="bu_homecoming.jpg" width="80%" />
          </figure>

      </li>
      <li> 
      <p>FOOD: Lunch before finals, burgers at a picnic, cookies and donuts. We like to break bread with each
        other, and we hope you get involved.  </p>
      
        
      
      </li>
      <li><p>Merch: We often order MCS or Belhaven STEM shirts, sweaters, hoodies, and such. 
      </p></li>  

      <li>
        <p>
          ScienceFest: Help us give back to the community by participating in ScienceFest, the largest
          science festival in the state. We help the Mississippi Children's Museum and Mississippi's Museum
          of Natural Science by showing math-based games (and other hands-on science experiments) to children
          of the Jackson metro.

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-communicate">
  <title>Good Communication</title>
  <p>
    Good communication is so undervalued. <term>Go talk to your professors</term>. At Belhaven,
    we want to know our students. Meet your classmates. They're going to help you through
    this next assignmnent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Download the Microsoft Team app, and join the BelhavenSTEM Team. We post about upcoming events and have a channel
    specific to internships, scholarships, and research opportunities.

  <title>Academic Experiences</title>

  <p>Your degree is measured in credit hours. You're taking classes ultimately to earn a degree. 
    You'll also expect some grades in those classes. <term>BUT let's be careful not to mistake grades and
    credit hours with actual learning.</term> Our goal in the MCS Department is provide an environment of
    true learning. We want you to adapt a mentality of a continual learning: one who learns inside
    and outside of the classroom.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    In addition to core classes such as Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, 
    and Differential Equations, Belhaven's MCS department delivers a number of curriculum add-ons. 
    Let's take a look at what additional academic experiences we offer.
    </p>

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-seminar">
    <title>STEM Seminar</title>
    <p>Meet professional scientists and mathematicians who share about what they do,
      how they got there, and how you can too. This is a great way to find internships and jobs.</p>

  <subsubsection> 
  <title>Mathematical Research</title>
  
  <p>In MAT 391, 392, 491 and 492, students participate in the mathematical research process 
  reviewing recent results of a select topic and attempting to further it. These students will
   present their findings as a poster and presentation at the Belhaven University Undergraduate 
   Research Symposium (BUURS) and our sectional meetings of the MAA.</p>

 <title>Belhaven Maker Campus</title>
 <p> 
  The Belhaven Maker Campus is a collaboration between Math &amp; Computer
  Science and Art &amp; Design featuring formative technologies such as 3D printers,
  CAD drawing systems, laser engraving, and more. We are a community of engineering 
  students, artists, and mathematicians wanting to get our hands busy making things
  with technology.

 <p>
  Join the Maker Campus, and you can gain access to both of our campuses 
  maker labs. Design your own creations and 3D print them! Customize your gear
  with laser etching or make custom stickers. There are a lot of possibilities, and
  the Maker Campus is designed to make your ideas a reality.

      <title>The Eyes of Faith Portfolio</title>
  
  <p>What does the Bible say about mathematics? What does life as a Christian mathematician entail? 
  What role does change and randomness play in God's creation? These are deep questions that we will 
  ask ourselves during throughout our mathematics coursework at Belhaven.
  </p>

  <p> The book <term>Mathematics through the Eyes of Faith</term> by Russell Howell and James Bradley 
  approaches these questions in an intellectually honest manner <xref ref="biblio-eyes"/>. Students will 
  use this text as a reference to write their own thoughts in their <term>Eyes of Faith Portfolio</term>,
  a collaboration of Eyes of Faith papers written over several courses covering chapter of our reference text.
  </p>

  <p> The chapter breakdown follows curiously close to our major requirements and 
  is summarized in the following table. (You might want to hang on to this one.)

      <title>For Engineering Majors</title>
  
  <p> In addition to academic experiences math majors experience, students in Belhaven's engineering partnership 
    <ui>
      <li>learn AutoCAD in PHY 119 Intro to Engineering</li>
      <li>interact with professional engineers from places like Yates construction, Raytheon, and Asset Engineering.</li>
      <li>take site visits to Ole Miss, Mississippi State, and places like Nissan and the U.S.
       Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center (ERDC).</li>
    </ui>

  <p>For those majoring in Actuarial Sciences (ASM), students will
    <ui>
      <li>learn statistical software such as R,</li>
      <li> sit for the first actuarial exam, the Probability Exam (SOA Exam P).</li>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-doublemajor">
  <title>Double Major and Minors</title>

  <p>
    A mathematics major is very valuable, but pairing a math degree with another field
    will bring more opportunities than you might expect. We recommend either double-majoring
    or minoring in the following areas:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computer Science
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Chemistry or Physics
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Business or Accounting
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tradigital Art
        </p>
      </li>
     
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides these recommended degrees, we have had double majors in Dance, Theatre, 
    Music, History, English, and so much more. 
  </p>
