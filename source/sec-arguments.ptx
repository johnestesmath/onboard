  <title>Good Arguments</title>

  <p> The political scene of ancient Greece was pretty wild. City-states separated
    by Greece's rough terrain of mountains and the Mediterranean competed for power, and
    the wealthy and influential in each city wrestled for political influence for control
    of their community. Democracy allowed the people to decide on leadership and policy, and
    so rhetoric became the tool of competition among those seeking power.  </p>

    <p>
      This may be hard to believe, but sometimes politicians try to convince their audience 
     to take a position with improper tactics. We would say that in these instances they make a
     flawed argument. Circa 300 BC, as the Greek politicians scrambled for influence, the great philosopher Aristotle 
     began developing a system to analyze arguments. This system became what we know as "classical logic", and because of his work, 
     Aristotle (382-322 BC)is known as the father of logic.

    <p>
      To know how to analyze arguments, we should define what an argument is. An <term>argument</term> is simply a sequence
      of logical statements. The <term>conclusion</term> of an arugment is the ending statement of the argument, and a <term>premise</term> is
      a logical statement used to support the conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example: All cheaters sit in the back row. Monty sits in the back row. Therefore, Monty is a cheater.
    </p>

    <question xml:id="q-validarg1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Without any knowledge of how to validate an argument, do you think the previous argument is
          a valid one?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </question>
    <p> So an argument is a sequence of statements? Obviously we can make nonsensical sequences of statements, so how do we know
      if an argument is a good one or not? 
      We say an argument is <term>valid</term> if the conclusion is logically supported by its premises, so the argument
      from <xref ref="q-validarg1"/> is not valid since non-cheaters could sit in the back row.
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-commonarguments">
      <title>Common Arguments</title>

      <p>
        So how do we determine an argument to be valid? With logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good understanding of logic can help us determine whether a given argument is valid or not.
        We already looked at some basic logic principles in <xref ref="sec-logicpuzzle"/>, namely the 
        conditional <m>p \rightarrow q</m> and the contrapositive <m> \sim q \rightarrow \sim p</m>. These two 
        statements provide the framework of the two most basic, valid arguments.
      </p>

      <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-modusponens">
        <title>Modus Ponens</title>

        <p>
          The <term>modus ponens</term> argument (translated from "affirming mode") consists of three parts
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>p \rightarrow q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>p</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Therefore, <m>q</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The modus ponens argument is simply saying, "if <m>p</m> happens, then so does <m>q</m> and <m>p</m> happens (or is true). Therefore,
          <m>q</m> happens as well (or is also true)". This is definitely a valid argument.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-modusponens">
          <title>Modus Ponens</title>
           
          <p>
            For example: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore Socrates is mortal.
          </p>
          
        </example>

        <question xml:id="q-modusponens1">

            <statement>
              <p>
                Craft a modus ponens argument of your own.
              </p>
            </statement>          
        </question>


      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-modustollens">
        <title>Modus Tollens</title>

        <p>
          Like modus ponens, the <term>modus tollens</term> argument (translated from "method of denying") consists of three parts
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>p \rightarrow q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\sim q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Therefore, <m>\sim p</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The modus tollens argument makes use of the contrapositive. It's saying, "if <m>p</m> happens, then so does <m>q</m> and <m>q</m> does not happen (or is false). Therefore,
          <m>p</m> does not happen (or is also false)". This is also a valid argument.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-modustullens">
          <title>Modus Tollens</title>
           
          <p>
            For example: If it's a bird, then it lays eggs. It does not lay eggs. Therefore, it's not a bird.
          </p>
          
        </example>

        <p>
          What about this example? If it's a bird, then it lays eggs. It lays eggs. Therefore, it's a bird. Is this a valid argument?
        </p>

        <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-converseerrors">
          <title>Converse Errors</title>
          
        <p>
          Nah. This is not a valid argument. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We just made <term>converse error</term>, and invalide argument of the form 
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>p \rightarrow q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                q
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Therefore, <m>p</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
         But we can think of several instances in which this is not a valid argument.
        </p>

        <question xml:id="q-converseerror1">
          <title>Eggs and Birds?</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              We incorrectly concluded that since it lays eggs, it's a bird. Give an example
              where this is false.

          </statement>
          
          
          
        </question>

        <p>
          Sadly, converse errors are used all the time! Feel empowered to recognize them and point them out!
        </p>

      </subsubsection>
        
        <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-inverse">
          <title>Inverse Errors</title>

          <p>
            What about this example? If the boy rides his skateboard wrecklessly, then he will break his arm. 
            He did not ride his skateboard wrecklessly. Therefore, he did not break his arm.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's more than one way to break an arm, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            We just made an <term>inverse error</term> with this invalid argument form
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>p \rightarrow q </m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>\sim p</m>
                </p>
              </li>

              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember, that an argument is valid if its conclusion is supported by its premises. The conclusion
            <m>\sim q</m> is not supported logically by the other premises.
