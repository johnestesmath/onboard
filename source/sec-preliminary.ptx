      <title>The Goal of Onboarding to Mathematics</title>

      <p>
        Welcome to Overview of Mathematics! This book is different in its aim from most mathematics texts that you'll encounter. 
        Whereas most textbooks will dig into the details of a particular topic (one topic, no doubt, worth the effort it takes to dig into), 
        <em>Onboarding to Mathematics</em> will look at a variety of topics.
      </p>

       <term> Who is this book for? </term>
      </p>

      
        
        <p>
            Most in-coming mathematics majors probably choose their major because of the success they had in high school. 
            I chose to study mathematics in college just because I enjoyed my
            high school courses and wanted to do some more math. But what do math majors do? What is in store for the
            freshman math major? 
          </p>

        <p>
            This text is for the young math major (and anyone interested in the things that undergraduate mathematics thinks abouts) to
            get a glimpse of things on the path that they have began walking upon.

       <term> What this book is not </term>
      </p>

      
        <p>
            We should mention that this book is not exhaustive in any sense. We will not turn over every stone on any given subject and 
            will look at these subjects at a somewhat surface level. We also admit that certain things will be left out, but we are confident
            those topics will be addressed at a sophisticated level in separate courses.
        </p>

      <p>
       <term> So what is the point of this book?</term>
      </p>

      

        <p> 
       
            <term> "Onboarding" </term> is the process of introducing a new person into the culture and customs of an organization, and that is
            exactly what this text is about. <em>Onboarding to Mathematics</em> seeks to introduce students to the 
            wonderful world of mathematics and its vibrant community.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            In particular, we hope to introduce
            <ol>
              <li>
                the culture of the mathematics community both locally at Belhaven 
                along with the broader community of mathematicians across the world,
              </li>
              <li>snapshots of common math topics in interactive ways,  </li>
              <li> and skills to maximize success as a student. </li>
            </ol> 
            And we hope to have some fun while doing it. 
          </p> 

          <remark>
            Best practices for this course are just showing up with a good attitude and
            having a curiosity about math topics.
