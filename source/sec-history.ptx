  <title>A Little History</title>


  <p> Mathematics is a permanent fixture in human development. We find evidence of mathematical thinking in
    our most ancient of civilizations, and yet all modern technological advancements rely of good mathematics.
    Mathematics is the foundational tool we use to turn creative ideas into reality. But the human stories of
    mathematics is an area worth studying as well.
 </p>

 
 <p>
    Throughout your coursework, you will learn about the interesting figures of math history and some of the
    incredible (and sometimes unbelievable) tales they are a part of. There are stories of young genius, incredible
    risks, underdogs, and duels. You will hear about mathematical giants from all over the world and how their contributions
    are still valuable to us today. Math history is
    rich and immensely interesting.

   <title>What we take for granted</title>

   <p>
      We learn about rationals, primes, and equations by the time we get to 
      middle school, but so many of these ideas were unknown for generations. We take
      so much of our foundational mathematics for granted, but behind a lot of these concepts
      are moments of ingenious insight.

      For example, 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Our numerals are referred as "Hindu-Arabic numerals" invented by Indian mathematicians between the first
            and fourth centuries. <!-- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system-->

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The discovery of irrational numbers threw the Pythagoreans into an existential crisis in the 4th century.

            In the 17th century, mathematicians and philosophers Rene Descarte and Piere de Fermat independently connected
            geometry and algebra with a coordinate system we use in basic algebra today. This system is called
            "Cartesian coordiantes" after Descartes.

  <title>Thinking Differently</title>

  <p>
    Studying math history also helps us see how culture impacts the way we think about things... even objective ideas such as mathematics.  
    We can see that ancient cultures sometimes approached their problems from a perspective we might find unusual.

        Ancient Egyptians were excellent at calculations, with applications in areas of economics, land area, and volumes of solids. They
        developed algorithms to help perform complicated calculations with high accuracy. We will look at their alogrithm for multiplying
        two integers.
      </p>
      
  
    <p>
      For example, How would the Egyptians multiply 23 and 12? Their work all depends upon powers of two.

    <title>Mathematics of Babylon</title>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, due to the again of papyrus, we have few resources to pull from regarding Egyptian mathematics. However,
      the Babylonians baked their writings in cuneiform on clay tablets. This more durable writing system has provided us with a lot of 
      information regarding Babylonian mathematics dating back to 1700 BC.
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure> <!-- source: https://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/before-pythagoras/items/plimpton-322/ -->
        <image xml:id="fig-plimpton322" source="P322obv.png" width="80%" />
        <caption>The Babylonian cuneiform tablet: Plimpton 322</caption>
      </figure>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Babylon made a lot of advancement in mathematics with knowledge of cubic equations and Pythagoras' namesake, the Pythagorean 
      Theorem (about 1000 years before Pythagoras), but we will just focus on the Babylonian number system. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Babylonians tracked numbers in base-60 (sexigesimal). Though that may sound odd, we still
      use sexigesimal systems when thinking about time (60 seconds to a minute) and angle measure (<m>360^{\circ}</m> in a circle).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So what does sexigesimal notation look like? Think about typing <m>100</m> on a microwave. After a second, what
      does that microwave read? Not <m>99</m>, right? The microwave knows that <m>1</m> minute means <m>60</m> seconds, and
      so after a second, we see <m>59</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, the Babylonian would write <m>1,00 </m> for what we mean by <m>60</m>. We would read a number like <m>11,32,54</m> base-60 as
      <m>11 \cdot 60^2 + 32 \cdot 60^1 + 54 \cdot 60^0 = 41,574</m> base-10.
    </p>

    <question xml:id="ques-baby1">
      <title>Sexigesimal Practice</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Convert <m>23,10,11</m> into base-10.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>23,10,11 = 23\cdot 60^2 + 10 \cdot 60^1 + 11 \cdot 60^0 = 83,411.</m>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </question>

    <p>
      Sexigesimal notation is particularly useful when dealing with fractions. For example, <m>1;30</m>
      is <m>1\cdot 60^0 + 30 \cdot 60^{-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}</m>, and by <m>0;30;24</m>, the Babylonians
      meant <m>\frac{30}{60^1} + \frac{24}{60^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To calculate <m> \frac{a}{b} </m>, Babylonians would first find <m>\frac{1}{b}</m> and then 
      multiply it by <m>a </m>. For example, <m>\frac{7}{2} </m> is found first by finding <m>\frac{1}{2} = 0;30 </m> and then
      multiply the result by <m>7 </m> to get
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>
        \dfrac{7}{2} = 7 \cdot \dfrac{1}{2} = 7 \cdot (0;30) = 0;210 = 3;30.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We finish our calculation by recognizing <m>210 = 60\cdot 3 + 30 </m>.
