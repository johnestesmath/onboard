  <title>Surfaces</title>

  <p> Most of our lives is not spent in a 2D world (is any of it?), so why
    would we only look at mathematics in a 2D world? Most of our experiences
  are three dimensional, so it only makes sense to think about mathematics in a 
3D environment.  </p>

<p>
  There are two ways we can visualize a 3D surface. The first way you 
  might consider is having two independent variables, <m>x \text{ and } y</m>,
  and one dependent variable, <m>z</m>. So functions of this form are written
  as 

  <me>z = f(x,y).</me>
</p>

<p>
  You can see the surface <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2</m> below.

  <title>Contour Plots: Connecting 2D and 3D Shapes</title>
  <p>
    There's something familiar about <m>f(x,y)= x^2 + y^2</m>. Where have you 
    seen something like that before? Well, we know <m>x^2 + y^2 = k^2</m> is a 2D object: a circle
    with radius <m>k</m>. We so can think of these circles as a part of <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2</m>. If you
    sliced <m>f(x,y)</m> at height <m>k^2</m> and put that slice on a plate, the result would be the 
    circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = k^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
     These slices are called <term>contours</term> or <term><m>k</m>-curves</term> of <m>f(x,y)</m>, and
     each <m>k</m>- curve of a 3D function results in a 2D object. Keep in mind that when you study <term>explicitly
      defined functions </term> in the 2D sense, you are actually studying <m>k</m>-curves of a 3D function.

  <title>Contour</title>

  <p>
    What if there's some type of mathematical object whose contour is a 3D surface itself? 
    Can you think of how that would work? Yeah, we would need a 4D surface set equal to a constant. That is,
    <me>f(x,y,z) = k.</me>
