  <title>Good Arguments</title>

  <p> The political scene of ancient Greece was pretty wild. City-states separated
    by Greece's rough terrain of mountains and the Mediterranean competed for power, and
    the wealthy and influential in each city wrestled for political influence for control
    of their community. Democracy allowed the people to decide on leadership and policy, and
    so rhetoric became the tool of competition among those seeking power.  </p>

    <p>
      This may be hard to believe, but sometimes politicians try to convince their audience 
     about taking a position with bad improper tactics. We would say that in these instances they make a
     flawed argument. Circa 300 BC, as the Greek politicians scrambled for influence, the great philosopher Aristotle 
     began developing a system to analyze arguments. This system became what we know as "classical logic", and because of his work, 
     Aristotle is known as the father of logic.

      To know how to analyze arguments, we should define what an argument is. An <term>argument</term> is simply a sequence
      of logical statements. The <term>conclusion</term> is the ending statement of the argument, and a <term>premise</term> is
      a logical statement used to support the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p> So an argument is a sequence of statements? Obviously we can make nonsensical sequences of statements, so how do we know
      if an argument is a good one or not? 
       An argument is <term>valid</term> if the conclusion is logically supported
    </p>
    <p>
      Good understanding of logic can help us determine whether a given argument is valid or not.
      We already looked at some basic logic principles in <xref ref="sec-logicpuzzle"/>, namely the 
      conditional <m>p \rightarrow q</m> and the contrapositive <m> \sim q \rightarrow \sim p</m>.
