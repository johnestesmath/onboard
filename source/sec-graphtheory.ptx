  <p>Jane and her friend Julia were invited to a small get together at their
    friend Julio's place. When they arrive, they don't really know any of the other
  four people (other than Julio) who seem to know each other EXCEPT one of the four coincidentally
  is Jane's cousin, Elaine.  </p>

    This type situations happen all of the time. If you're sitting in a classroom, you're in a
    similar situation right now. When you are with a group of people, you are a part of a mathematical structure known as a <term>graph</term>.
    Actually, any network (relationships, pipe systems, road maps, the internet, ...) can be represented as graphs.

  <p>
    GRAPH PICS
  </p>

  <p>
    We see graphs anytime we have a collection of items (We call them <term>vertices </term> or <term>nodes</term>.) and relationships
    between those items (We call the relationships <term>edges</term>.). 
    In fact, it is by the vertices and edges that we define a graph.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-graph">
    <statement>
      <p>
      A graph <term>G</term> is a pair of two sets <m>V</m> and <m>E</m>, 
      where <m>V</m> is the set of vertices and <m>E</m> is the set of edges on <m>G</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <title>Touring the City of Konigsburg</title>

      If we happen to find ourselves in Konigsburg Prussia in the 18th century, we would see a city layout similar to the one
      in FIGURE. The Pregel river flowed through the middle of the city forming two
      islands. The part we care about, though, is the seven bridges highlighted in FIGURE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The incredibly brilliant mathematician, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), proposed the now famous question:
      Can someone take a tour of Konigsburg in which all seven bridges are crossed exactly one time, and
      the tourist returns back to his or her starting position? If so, we'll call that a successful tour of Konigsburg.
